# Arduino PC/PS3 compatible gamepad

This is Arduino code for making a gamepad using an ATmega32U4-based board.

Tested with an Arduino Pro Micro, works out of the box with at least PC and PS3.

Supports emulating left analog stick, to enable this mode, hold left when plugging the device in (or just change the default mode in code).

[See here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4838081) for an example of a controller made using this code.
